- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @tobybutchart
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in programming, generative techniques, anything interesting
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C#

I am a Delphi, PHP and Web developer with 10 years programming experience.

I am a passionate programmer and I pride myself on my ability to write clean, maintainable code.

I specialise in systems design and hardware integration and always look forward to learning new tech stacks and new ways to apply my already strong skill set and problem-solving abilities.
